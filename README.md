## Business Understanding
- Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly reduce its impact. This project focuses on building a predictive model for stroke risk, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers to improve early detection, prioritize high-risk individuals, and implement targeted interventions.
    ### Business questions 
    1. Who are the individuals most at risk of experiencing a stroke based on their demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics?
    2. Which factors (e.g., age, smoking status, glucose levels, hypertension) are the most significant predictors of stroke?
    3. How accurately can we predict the likelihood of a stroke using the given data?
    4. What preventive actions or healthcare measures can be recommended for high-risk groups?
    5. Can we design a model that is interpretable and can be used effectively by healthcare providers in both high- and low-resource settings?
## Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based stroke prediction model that identifies individuals at high risk of stroke, providing insights to guide preventive healthcare strategies
## Problem statement
- Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. Early prediction and intervention can significantly reduce stroke-related mortality and morbidity. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of stroke using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data. The insights gained could help in creating targeted prevention strategies and optimizing healthcare resources.
## Data Understanding
- we explore the dataset to understand its structure, quality, and relevance to the project.The dataset typically contains various demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors that influence the likelihood of stroke.
